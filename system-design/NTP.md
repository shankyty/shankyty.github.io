# Network Time Protocol
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) comes in. It's a long-standing and robust protocol designed specifically to solve this problem by synchronizing the clocks of all machines on a network to a single, highly accurate time source.

# How it works:
NTP organizes time servers in a hierarchy called "strata."

Stratum 0: These are the ultimate time sources, like atomic clocks or GPS clocks. They are highly precise but not directly accessible over the network.

Stratum 1: These are servers directly connected to Stratum 0 devices. They act as the primary time sources for the network.

Stratum 2: These servers synchronize their time with Stratum 1 servers.

Stratum 3+: These servers synchronize with Stratum 2 servers, and so on.

An application server in a data center will typically be an NTP client that synchronizes its clock with a few Stratum 2 or 3 servers. By constantly communicating with these servers, it can calculate network latency and adjust its local clock, keeping it accurate to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
